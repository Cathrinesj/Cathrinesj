Oh wow - so happy you are here! Summer 2023 I finished 2 year study at Noroff - Font End Developer.
Now, I am super eager to find somewhere to learn and grow as a developer.

I am a 36 year old woman living in the rainy westcoast of Norway (pretty sure u can guess where 😉).
Once upon a time i finished a bachelor degree in Business administration, and since then, I have been with the same company,
though with many different responsibilities. Some years ago, I had project lead* on setting up new websites and webshop for our company,
and at some point I realised that this is what I want to do. 

And so I did. For the last three years I have done 1 year part time, one full, and the last year part time again - and now I am super happy to be done!
No secrets it has been rough at times, but I am thoroughly exited to start my new career off!

Have you dropped by here on accident, or might it be faith?

Do not hesitate to contact me - maybe we will meet up for a coffee? ☕

*project lead on our side of things as a customer - a uniqe experience I will bring with me!
